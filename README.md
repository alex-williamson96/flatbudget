<h1>Flat Budget</h1>
<p>Flat budget is simple a zero-based budgeting application.</p>

<p>Zero-based budgeting means that every dollar within the budget<br>
is given a purpose. The budget also only contains real money, <br>
meaning all cash, credits, and debits for the accounts being tracked.</p>

<p>This application was built using Spring Boot for the back end REST <br>
API, React for the front end, and MySQL for the database.</p>

<p>The back end and front end are compiled together at run time and <br>
requires maven to build and package the project. The front end is <br>
located within the 'webapp' folder and to run locally, requires <br>
<code>npm install</code> to be run within that directory to install <br>
dependencies.</p>
